# simple-messaging-app
This simple messaging app is a basic C-based application that allows messaging between users through directories. The application demonstrates foundational concepts in file handling and process management.

## Features

- **Send and receive messages**: Users can exchange messages by writing to and reading from specific directories.
- **Directory-based messaging**: The app uses directories to manage and store messages between users.
- **Basic file handling**: Implements basic file I/O operations to enable messaging functionality.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: C

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-messaging-app.git
    cd simple-messaging-app
    ```
2. **Compile the C code**:
    - Compile the `app.c` file using a C compiler:
    ```bash
    gcc app.c -o app.exe
    ```
3. **Run the executable**:
    - Run the compiled executable to start the messaging app:
    ```bash
    ./app.exe
    ```

## How It Works

- The app uses directories to facilitate communication between users, where messages are written to files within these directories.
- Users interact with the system through the command line, sending and receiving messages by accessing these directories.
